# Choosing a location for a well

Let's say you work for the oil company GlavRosGosNeft. We need to decide where to drill a new well.

We are provided with oil samples in three regions: in each 10,000 fields, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. 
We build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where drilling will bring the greatest profit. I analyze possible profits and risks using Bootstrap

# Result

The second region has wells with the most promissing oil reserves. We might expect a profit of 450 million rubles and a risk of loss of less than 2.5%
