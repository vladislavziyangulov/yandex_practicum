# Yandex music EDA

We are given a dataset of music tracks and the number of times they were played by the users of _Yandex Music_.
In the project, after data preprocessing, we check 3 hypotheses:

1. Music preferences are different in Moscow and St. Petersburg
2. Music preferences at the beginning of the week in the morning are different than music preferences at the end of the week in the evening
3. Users from St. Petersburg like listening to rap. Users from Moscow - pop
