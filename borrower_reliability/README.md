# Borrower reliability

The projects answers primary questions about borrower's ability to repay the loan on time.

1. Does the number of children affect the repayment?

    Yes, especially, among widows/widowers with more than 2 children;
   among single parents who have never been married;
   among people in a civil marriage with 1 child (they face difficulties repaying loans for the purpose of celebrating a wedding).
2. Does marital status affect the repayment?

    Yes, if a person is or used to be married, he/she is more likely to repay on time.
3. Does the level of income affect the repayment?

    Yes, people with income above 170,000 repay the loans on time more often.

Most debt corresponds to loans for the purposes: "transactions with car", "education"
