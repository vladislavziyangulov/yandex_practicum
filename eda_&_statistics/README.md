# Brief report

Games on the computer are released steadily, but they do not become the highest grossing ones. The most potentially profitable platforms are PS4, Xone, 3DS.

In Europe and North America, the most popular platforms are the X360 and PS4. Shooters are the best-selling genre of games. Also, games with more mature ratings have higher average sales among these users.

The Japanese differ from other users in their choice of platform, game genre and rating. They love the Role-Playing genre and the 3DS platform. The Japanese prefer unrated games.

User ratings vary depending on the genre. However, sales are weakly dependent on critic ratings and generally do not correlate linearly with user ratings.
