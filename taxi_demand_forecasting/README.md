# Taxi demand forecasting

A taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at an airport. 
To attract more drivers during peak periods, we need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. We build a model to make this prediction.

The value of the RMSE metric on the test sample should be no more than 48. 
The resulting model gave RMSE=33.5 on time-series cross-validation
